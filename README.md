# Project Report (15pts)
* Your final report should be a well-managed notebook (.ipynb).
* This notebook should document **ALL** of the ML model variants that you have attempted.
* You should think of each variant as an experiment, but you should measure/compare all experiments using a common metric.
* Your notebook should have a well identified section and appropriate subsections called "Experiments".
* Each Experiment should have an associated markdown cell that describes what the experiment is, and what conclusions you are drawing from that experiment.  Where appropriate I would expect graphs that explore some aspect of the feature space as the x-axis and the y-axis representing the best model performance that was observed with that hyperparameter.  Exploring multiple hyperparameters in a 3D graph could raise the bar.
* As a general rule of thumb I would expect (on average) two graphs per teammate. So if you have 6 teammates, I would expect about 12 graphs.
* You need a section that describes the best model that you were able to construct.

* **Penalties**: Data Leakage or any other bugs in your model training or data preparation can result in penalty up to 25%.  You should appropriately use Train, Validation and Test set in your experiments.

* Grading:
    * The Experiment section is 80% of your grade. 
    * Minimum number of experiments is 2 * Number of Teammates.
    * If you have 10 experiments, then each experiment would be worth 8% of your final grade.
    * For each experiment you need:
        * Graph that explores hyperparamter and achieved performance.
        * Markdown section that discusses the experiments, results of the experiment, what was learned.


# Project Presentation (Checkpoint 3) (10pts)
* Each team will give a 10 - 15 minute presentation, followed by 5-7 minute Q & A.  
* This only gives time for 5 to 7 slides.
* In that time you need to:
    * Define your problem
    * Review the source of your data.
    * Review interesting facets of your data (from EDA).
    * Review your experiments (What did you try, what ML models were trained, etc.)
    * What were your results.
* You can have a single presenter or you can have each team mate present a different slide.
* Your slides need to be committed to your repository before your presentation.
